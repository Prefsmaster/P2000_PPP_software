# P2000T Cassette files
This folder contains a lot of `.cas` cassette files of P2000T programs and games. \
These .cas files can be loaded into the M2000 emulator, or loaded on a real P2000T using a RS232 serial connection to a PC. \
Note: only Basic progams can be loaded from a PC using a RS232 connection, so not pure machine-language programs like Ghosthunt.
